A menu bar based scientific calculator for macOS!

## [Download here!](https://github.com/epdavid/Calx/releases)

macOS seems to have lacked an ultra-convenient and fully featured calculator app that's always there when you need it, does everything you might need it to do, and is out of the way when you don't. This guy lives in your menu bar and toggles between a four-function and full scientific calculator with a quick âŒ˜S. Every button has a keyboard shortcut making the app very quick to use, and smoothly supports copying and pasting to and from the clipboard. Comes with a light and dark mode (togglable from the '?' menu). Comes with a sloppily thrown together 'Today' widget if that's your thing. 

## Sought Improvements:
* Make the UI a little prettier (especially on the 'Today' widget)
* LaTeX-like math print
* Certain CAS functions (what  a dream it would be to have a handy little TI-89 in the menu bar).


## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to the [DDMathParser](https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser) framework, without which this app wouldn't have worked.
